This bug occurs when using the FlatList component in React Native with a large dataset. The performance is severely impacted, leading to laggy scrolling and janky animations. The issue stems from the default behavior of FlatList, which renders all items at once, even when not visible on the screen.  This consumes excessive memory and processing power, especially on lower-end devices.
